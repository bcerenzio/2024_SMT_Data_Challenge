<h3>

  Compiled here is all the code, plots, and final paper for my project. I have been named a finalist and will present my findings to a panel of judges along with the other finalists to determine a winner. In short, my project focused on Route
Efficiency among minor league outfielders at different levels using player and ball tracking data supplied by SMT. Using this data, I was able to do the following:


</h3>
<h4>
  
  - Created a Catch Probability Model That Took into Account Numerous Variables Including: Euclidean Distance to the Final Ball Position, Time to Catch/Drop, and Fielder Speed
  - Utilized this Catch Probability Model to Create a OAA and Route Score metric for each fielder
  - Created a Route Optimization Model That Determines the Best Route to Any Flyball (ie Finds the Route that Maximizes Catch Probability)
  - Modeled the Projected Path the Average Fielder at Each Level Would Take to a Given Flyball.

I created a Shiny App where you try the models for yourself here: https://team60.shinyapps.io/SMT_Data_Challenge_2024/
</h4>
<h4>Note: The app will crash after you run the Projected Path Model more than 1-2 times. This has to do with the limited amount of storage each app is allowed to have and is out of my control. I go into more detail about what's causing this error in my paper if you're interested.</h4>
