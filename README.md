  2024 SMT Data Challenge

<h3>

  Compiled here is all the code, plots, and final paper for my project. I have been named a finalist and will present my findings to a panel of judges along with the other finalists to determine a winner. In short, my project focused on Route
Efficiency among minor league outfielders at different using player and ball tracking data supplied by SMT. Using this data, I was able to do the following:


</h3>
<h4>
  
  - Created a Catch Probability Model That Took into Account Numerous Variables Including: Euclidean Distance to the Final Ball Position, Time to Catch/Drop, and Fielder Speed
  - Utilized this Catch Probability Model to Create a OAA and Route Score metric for each fielder
  - Created a Route Optimization Model That Determines the Best Route to Any Flyball (ie Finds the Route that Maximizes Catch Probability)
  - Modeled the Projected Path the Average Fielder at Each Level Would Take to a Given Flyball.
